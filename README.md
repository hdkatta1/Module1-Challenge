## KOHO  

* KOHO ~ A Canadian based fintech start up has been causing a stir in the traditional banking industry since it was founded in 2014. KOHO offers a reloadable Visa card and a mobile app that give its customers a distinctive banking experience. KOHO has gained a significant amount of users among Canadian millennials by removing the typical fees associated with conventional banking, offering other financial management tools, and providing cashback rewards. This case-study explores KOHO's ground-breaking business strategy and how it has revolutionised the Canadian banking sector.
  
  The idea for KOHO came about when its founder and CEO, Daniel Eberhard, was living in Kenya and working for a mobile banking company. He saw firsthand how mobile banking was revolutionizing financial services in Africa, and he realized that there was a similar opportunity in Canada to disrupt the traditional banking industry and provide a better banking experience for consumers.

Eberhard saw that many Canadians were dissatisfied with the high fees and limited services offered by traditional banks, and that there was a need for a more affordable and accessible alternative. He founded KOHO in 2014 with the goal of creating a mobile banking app and prepaid Visa card that would provide Canadians with a better way to manage their money and save more effectively.

Since its launch, KOHO has grown rapidly and has attracted millions of users who appreciate its user-friendly interface, cashback rewards program, and commitment to helping Canadians achieve financial well-being. The company has also expanded its product offerings to include a high-interest savings account and a premium subscription service that offers additional benefits and features.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? ~ KOHO Financial has raised a total of $278.9M in funding over 10 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Feb 1, 2022 from a Series D round.
KOHO Financial is funded by 20 investors. Round13 Capital and Portage Ventures are the most recent investors.(crunch base) 
KOHO makes money in one of two ways. The first is through Premium account subscriptions (but we're completely transparent about the user's costs!). The second is through interchange fees, the fees that merchants and retailers are charged whenever someone makes a purchase using a particular card.
