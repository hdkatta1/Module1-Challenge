## KOHO  

* KOHO ~ A Canadian based fintech start up has been causing a stir in the traditional banking industry since it was founded in 2014. KOHO offers a reloadable Visa card and a mobile app that give its customers a distinctive banking experience. KOHO has gained a significant amount of users among Canadian millennials by removing the typical fees associated with conventional banking, offering other financial management tools, and providing cashback rewards. This case-study explores KOHO's ground-breaking business strategy and how it has revolutionised the Canadian banking sector.
  
  The idea for KOHO came about when its founder and CEO, Daniel Eberhard, was living in Kenya and working for a mobile banking company. He saw firsthand how mobile banking was revolutionizing financial services in Africa, and he realized that there was a similar opportunity in Canada to disrupt the traditional banking industry and provide a better banking experience for consumers.

Eberhard saw that many Canadians were dissatisfied with the high fees and limited services offered by traditional banks, and that there was a need for a more affordable and accessible alternative. He founded KOHO in 2014 with the goal of creating a mobile banking app and prepaid Visa card that would provide Canadians with a better way to manage their money and save more effectively.

Since its launch, KOHO has grown rapidly and has attracted millions of users who appreciate its user-friendly interface, cashback rewards program, and commitment to helping Canadians achieve financial well-being. The company has also expanded its product offerings to include a high-interest savings account and a premium subscription service that offers additional benefits and features.

KOHO Financial has raised a total of $278.9M in funding over 10 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Feb 1, 2022 from a Series D round. KOHO Financial is funded by 20 investors. Round13 Capital and Portage Ventures are the most recent investors.(crunch base) 
KOHO makes money in one of two ways. The first is through Premium account subscriptions (but we're completely transparent about the user's costs!). The second is through interchange fees, the fees that merchants and retailers are charged whenever someone makes a purchase using a particular card.


## Business Activities:
KOHO aims to help people better manage their money and save more effectively. It solves the problem of hidden fees and lack of transparency in the traditional banking industry by offering a no-fee banking solution.The specific financial problem that KOHO is trying to solve is the issue of overspending and financial stress that many Canadians face. Any money you deposit with KOHO is stored at Peoples Trust which is a federally regulated bank. This means your money is CDIC-insured and 100% safe to use.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) international transfers, koho offers credit building, its slowly improving its features.
 If I were to advise KOHO, I would suggest that the company consider expanding its offerings to include investment and retirement planning services. While KOHO currently offers users the ability to set savings goals, there is an opportunity
 Savings and Investment Accounts: While KOHO currently offers a savings feature, they do not have a full-fledged savings or investment account option. Offering these types of accounts would allow customers to save and invest their money with KOHO, increasing the amount of money they hold with the company and potentially leading to more revenue for KOHO. The company could also look into offering high-yield savings or investment options to differentiate themselves from competitors.
International Money Transfer: Currently, KOHO does not offer international money transfer services. Adding this feature could be beneficial to customers who travel or have family and friends abroad, as it would allow them to easily and securely transfer money across borders. This could potentially attract a larger customer base and increase revenue for the company.
Enhanced Budgeting Tools: While KOHO does offer budgeting tools, they could consider enhancing them to include more personalized insights and recommendations for customers. This could involve using AI or machine learning algorithms to analyze customers' spending patterns and offer tailored advice for saving money or meeting financial goals.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
  Offering these new products or services could benefit KOHO by increasing their customer base, retaining current customers, and potentially leading to more revenue for the company.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  In terms of technologies that could be utilized for these new products or services, KOHO could consider:
Partnering with a third-party provider that specializes in international money transfer services, such as TransferWise or PayPal.
Implementing machine learning algorithms or AI technology to enhance their budgeting tools and offer personalized insights and recommendations for customers.
Utilizing blockchain technology for secure and transparent international money transfers.


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  Overall, these new products and services could benefit KOHO by providing more options for customers and increasing revenue for the company. Implementing new technologies could also enhance the customer experience and differentiate KOHO from their competitors.
